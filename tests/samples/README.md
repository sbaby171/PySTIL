### Header: 
All these samples focus primarily on the parsing methods for the STIL's Header block. 

* ./header/header_1.stil
  - This example is closely related to an example found within the STIL documentation
    in Seciton 9.2. I added the 'Title' field for more test coverage. 
  - Test contains all fields and mulitple annotations within the `History` field. 
* ./header/header_2.stil
  - This example contains the same contents of 'header_1' however, the syntax is 
    very poor, but valid.
